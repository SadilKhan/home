        __Project__ : [Learning Shapes For The Effective Segmentation of 3D Medical Images.](/publication/masterThesis)
        * Developed a novel approach to perform 3d Image Segmentation using point clouds.
        * Modified RandLaNet, an attention-based point cloud segmentation network, with a Feature Extraction Layer to learn local spatial information.
        * Developed a model-independent step to use the trained RandLaNet to perform 3d Image Segmentation.

        __Project__ : [Detector-Encoder Autoencoders for unsupervised decomposition into visual parts.](/publication/dae)
          
        * Developed DEA (Detector-Encoder AutoEncoder), a novel autoencoder for anomaly segmentation. 
        * Optimized SSD Detector with GIOU loss. 
        * Designed AutoLabelMe, a GUI in Python for automatic Image Annotation. Itâ€™s suitable for researchers and practitioners to automatically annotate objects in images for object detection.

        __Project__ : Intelligent Inventory Planning
        * Due to sudden unexpected changes such as increasing demand trend, introduction of competitive products, phasing out of a product result in forecast-demand gaps. The objective is to predict the daily or weekly hedging to cover for demand gaps based on past data of variation of forecast/Consumption.
        * Focused on Hypothesis driven approach and applied XgBoost algorithm.
        * Created a web-scrapper in Python to collect weather data. 
        * Model interpretation using What-IF tool in Google Cloud Platform.
